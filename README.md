# What this Program does?

Blackboard is a very barebones whiteboard application with a dark theme (hence the name). Currently it only allows you to choose from 7 predefined colors.  

There are two modes of operation Stroke mode and Rect mode. In stroke mode a "line" is drawn when your mouse is dragged along the screen. While in Rect mode a rectangle is drawn when you drag your mouse along the screen.

You can also undo and redo Strokes and Rects (which are called shapes in blackboard lingo). 

# Controls

Blackboard is very minimal. Currently there are no fancy menus. You are initially in normal mode with the color white.
To change colors simply click on a number key from 1-7. Each number key is mapped to a color.

To Undo a stroke shape type z (not Ctrl+z cause the Ctrl key is annoyting). To redo the shape simply type in r.

To Clear the screen type in c.

To switch to Rect mode simply type in s (the r is taken and s stands for square which is close enough). Once the a rect is drawn you are back to stroke mode.
